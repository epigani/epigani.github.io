Statistical physicist by training, with broad interests in applications of statistical mechanics.
Postdoctoral researcher at the International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, where I work in the [qEcoEvo group](https://jacopogrilli.github.io/group/) led by [Jacopo Grilli](https://jacopogrilli.github.io/).
During my PhD, I developed and applied theoretical frameworks to investigate emergent properties in microbial communities, using phytoplankton as a case study. My research combines theoretical modeling with data-driven approaches to link fundamental principles to ecological dynamics, with particular interest in the functional organization and stability of microbial systems.
